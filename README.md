# gofish-v3

to take a card just make sure your statment contains the word 'take' and one valid card type and one valid player name.

Currentally all mistakes are fatal. At some point i'll add a way to re-enter input if there's a mess up. Examples that work: 'take all ace cards from player2', 'player2 fart nugget tool headphones 5 take'
I have it set up to ignore all other useless words.


I don't really know how to use pytest very well yet.
The imports don't work for running pytest and then gofish/main.py
Which is really annoying so if you know how to fix that, that would be great!
